# **Why FortiGate is Considered Highly Reliable**

FortiGate firewalls are known for their reliability because they provide **consistent performance**, **strong security**, and **stable long-term operation**. Here are the key reasons:

## **1. Custom Security Hardware (SPU Chips)**

Fortinet uses its own **Security Processing Units (SPUs)** instead of relying only on general-purpose CPUs.
These chips handle:

* Encryption
* IPS
* Threat inspection
* Application control

This means the firewall **does not slow down** even when multiple security features are enabled.

## **2. FortiOS – Stable, Mature Operating System**

FortiOS is Fortinet’s own OS, developed for more than 20 years.

It is:

* Lightweight
* Optimized
* Very stable
* Consistent across all models

This makes FortiGate devices run for **months or years** without issues.

## **3. Security Fabric Integration**

Everything (firewall, VPN, endpoint, switches, Wi-Fi, cloud) works together under the **Fortinet Security Fabric**.

This reduces configuration errors and increases reliability.

## **4. Real-Time Threat Intelligence (FortiGuard)**

FortiGate receives continuous updates from **FortiGuard Labs**, one of the largest threat research teams in the world.

This ensures:

* Latest malware signatures
* URL filtering updates
* IPS signatures
* Zero-day protection

Reliable protection = reliable firewall.


## **5. High VPN & Network Performance**

FortiGate is extremely reliable in:

* IPsec VPN
* SSL VPN
* SD-WAN
* High-throughput data centers

Thanks to SPU acceleration, tunnels remain stable even at high load.

## **6. Enterprise-Grade Hardware**

FortiGate devices are built for 24/7 environments:

* Strong build quality
* Redundant power supply (in higher models)
* Active-passive HA support
* Automatic failover

This prevents downtime even during hardware failure.

## **7. Simplified & Predictable Management**

GUI + CLI both are:

* Easy to use
* Clean
* Well-documented

This reduces human mistakes, making the system more reliable.

## **Conclusion**

FortiGate is reliable because it combines:
✔ Strong hardware
✔ Mature OS
✔ Constant threat updates
✔ High performance
✔ Automatic failover
✔ Easy management

This is why enterprises, banks, service providers, and governments trust FortiGate for mission-critical networks.

# **Why FortiGate Has Stronger Security Than Many Other Vendors — And How**

FortiGate is widely considered stronger in security because of its **architecture**, **hardware acceleration**, and **deeply integrated threat intelligence**. Instead of relying only on software like most vendors, Fortinet builds everything end-to-end.

Below is the full explanation:

# **1. Custom Security Processors (SPU) → Faster + Deeper + Real-Time Inspection**

Most vendors (Cisco ASA, Sophos, WatchGuard) rely mainly on general-purpose CPUs.

Fortinet uses **dedicated security hardware**:

* **NP (Network Processor)** → Accelerates firewall, routing, NAT
* **CP (Content Processor)** → Accelerates antivirus, IPS, SSL inspection
* **SoC processors** → Integrated security on smaller devices

### Result:

* Full security features ON without slowdowns
* High throughput IPS/AV
* Real-time threat inspection
* Better performance under heavy attack

This alone gives FortiGate a **huge advantage**.

# **2. FortiGuard – One of the Largest Threat Intelligence Networks**

FortiGuard Labs has:

* 200+ threat researchers
* 100M+ sensors worldwide
* AI-based malware detection
* 24/7 global monitoring

FortiGate gets continuous updates:

* IPS signatures
* Malware signatures
* URL filtering
* Zero-day detection
* Botnet/command-and-control protection

### Result:

Faster detection and blocking than most vendors.


# **3. Security Fabric — Everything Works Together**

Other vendors sell products separately (firewall, endpoint, switch, WiFi).

Fortinet’s **Security Fabric** integrates:

* Firewall
* Endpoint (FortiClient)
* Switch (FortiSwitch)
* Access Points (FortiAP)
* SIEM (FortiAnalyzer)
* Sandbox (FortiSandbox)

### Result:

* Threat seen on endpoint → blocked on firewall instantly
* Zero trust checks across entire network
* Better visibility, fewer configuration holes

This ecosystem is unmatched by many competitors.

# **4. Deep SSL Inspection (Without Big Performance Drop)**

Most vendors struggle with SSL Decryption because it is CPU-heavy.

FortiGate can decrypt **huge volumes** of traffic because:

* CP/NP chips accelerate SSL
* FortiOS engine is optimized
* Lowest performance drop in the industry

### Result:

FortiGate detects hidden malware that many firewalls can't.

# **5. Multi-layer Security Engines**

FortiGate uses multiple advanced engines:

* Antivirus engine
* Static analysis
* Dynamic sandbox analysis
* Behavioral analysis
* Machine-learning IPS
* Anti-bot engine
* Application control
* Web filtering categories

Instead of one engine per feature, Fortinet stacks **multiple layers**, giving stronger results.

# **6. Mature OS (FortiOS) With Fewer Bugs & More Stability**

FortiOS is:

* Very optimized
* Very stable
* Used for 20+ years
* Same OS for all models

Cisco ASA, WatchGuard, etc. have many limitations or use outdated code.

# **7. High Availability & Failover Reliability**

FortiGate supports:

* Active/Active HA
* Active/Passive HA
* Failover in milliseconds
* Sync of sessions and firewall state

This means **even during attack or failure, it stays online**.

# **8. Comparison Summary With Common Vendors**

| Feature                 | FortiGate    | Cisco ASA  | Palo Alto     | Sophos  |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Hardware Security Chips | ✔ Strong     | ✖ None     | ✖ None        | ✖ None  |
| SSL Inspection Speed    | ✔ Very High  | ✖ Very Low | ✔ Good        | ✖ Slow  |
| Threat Intelligence     | ✔ FortiGuard | ✔ Talos    | ✔ Wildfire    | Average |
| Integrated Ecosystem    | ✔ Excellent  | ✖ Basic    | ✔ Good        | Average |
| Price-to-Performance    | ✔ High       | ✖ Low      | ✖ Very costly | ✔ Low   |

FortiGate usually wins in:

* **Performance**
* **Security layers**
* **Real-time threat updates**
* **Price**

## **Conclusion**

FortiGate provides stronger security because it combines:

✔ Custom-built security processors
✔ One of the world’s biggest threat intelligence networks
✔ Deep SSL inspection without slowdown
✔ Multiple advanced security engines
✔ Full ecosystem integration under Security Fabric
✔ A mature, stable operating system

This combination gives FortiGate *enterprise-level protection*, unmatched performance, and a security architecture stronger than many other firewall vendors.
